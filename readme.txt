This plugin integrates the Galleria jQuery plugin with Wordpress.


== Description ==

GalleriaPress aims to replace the current Wordpress Gallery with one implemented by the excellent Galleria.js jQuery plugin. 

With a simple Drag and Drop interface, you can add images from the standard WordPress media library, as well as Picasa and Youtube
(you need to enter the username and pictures or videos have to be public). You can mix and match pictures and videos in the same
gallery.

You can link galleries to a Gallery Profile. Change the profile settings and it is updated throughout all the linked Galleries.

This plugin is still under development and still needs testing. I will be continually improving the plugin over time.


== Installation ==
